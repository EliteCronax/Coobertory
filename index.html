            <h2>Coobert's Lore</h2>
            <p>Coobert wasn't shown to the world from a picture by me.. Coobert wasn't named by me.. This cat that I named Coobert was only inspired by a dog named Scoobert, and a cat that I found on Pintrest whilst sesrching for "funny cats". This was about 2 years ago with me being as bored as I am right now creating a pretty stupid website for a probably fictional feline that was taking a bath with it's owner taking a funny picture of it and posting it wherever</p>
